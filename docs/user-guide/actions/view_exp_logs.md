# Viewing Experiment Logs and Results Data 

Each experiment generates logs and this information is generated during the run of the experiment and is saved. If an experiment _did not_ print out data during execution, the logs are blank.

Separate from the logs, the results or output of an experiment can be found by mounting the userâ€™s output folder or output-shared folder. A model file should write to the Nauta output folder to save any output files. 

Execute following command to view logs from a given experiment where `mnist-tb` is shown in the experiment logs, this indicates the name of the experiment).

**Syntax:** `nctl experiment logs [options] EXPERIMENT-NAME`

**Example:** `nctl experiment logs mnist-tb`

**Result:** The following result displays an _example log_ (where mnist-tb is shown in the experiment logs this indicates the name of the experiment).

**Note:** Logs generated with sub-millisecond frequency may appear out of order when displayed. This is caused by the 1ms resolution of the underlying logging solution.
