# How to Build the Nauta Command Line Interface

Should you decide to build the Nauta Command Line Interface (nctl), then reference this section to build the CLI for Nauta. This section discusses the following main topics:

 - [Ubuntu Requirements](#ubuntu-requirements)  
 - [MacOS High Sierra Requirements](#macos-high-sierra-or-later-requirements)

## Nauta Development Requirements

The following Operating System (Ubuntu and macOS) are required to build the Nauta CLI. 

## Ubuntu Requirements

### Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

* python 3.6
* python3.6-dev
* python3.6-venv
* build-essential
* binutils
* curl
* git

You can use the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.6 python3.6-dev python3.6-venv build-essential binutils curl
```
## MacOS High Sierra (or later) Requirements

* python 3.6
* python3-venv
* python3-dev
* binutils
* make
* curl
* git

## Windows 10 Requirements

* [Python 3.6.5 64-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-amd64.exe)

* [make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

* [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

* [wget](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/)

* [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/)

Ensure that you have these tools available system-wide via command-line (add them to PATH).

### Proxy Settings

Make sure you have the following settings: http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy environment variables if you are behind proxy. The no_proxy must include: 127.0.0.1 and localhost.

## Building nctl

Make sure the development requirements above are met. In the applications/cli directory run: make build. As a result, artifacts are available in `dist` directory, including `nctl` binary.

Should you need to rebuild nctl after any changes, you can invoke `make clean build` (it cleans only the dist and build directories) or trigger `make full_clean build` to recreate also _.venv_ directory.

If you want to create `tar.gz` package with nctl, invoke `make nctl-build` from main directory in the repository.

After successful build, the `tar.gz` file can be found in `applications/cli` directory. The Package contains the nctl binary and all dependencies, such as Helm. Also, docs and examples directories will be available.

### Available make Commands and Targets

`make clean` - Removes build artifacts only

`make full_clean` - Removes build artifacts and virtual env

`make build` - Builds cli app

`make pack` - Creates a tar.gz package with `nctl` artifacts 

`make venv` - Creates _.venv_ with all modules required by nctl
