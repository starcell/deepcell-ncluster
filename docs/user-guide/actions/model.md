# model Command

Use the `model` command to manage model export related tasks. Use the `model` command to manage model export related tasks. The `model`command has the following subcommands:

 - [status Subcommand](#status-subcommand)

```

Displays details of 3 model export operations: two of them finished with success, one failed.

## export Subcommand

### Synopsis
 
Exports an existing model located in the `PATH` folder to a given `FORMAT` with given options. If the`formats` option is given, it displays a list of available export formats.    

### Syntax
 
 `nctl model export PATH/formats FORMAT [-- operation options]`
  
 ### Options

| Name | Required | Description | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
|`-u, --username` | No | Name of a user to whom viewed operations belongs. If not given, only models of a current user are taken into account. |
|`-f, --force`| No | Force command execution by ignoring (most) confirmation prompts |
|`-v, --verbose`| No | Set verbosity level: <br>`-v` for INFO, <br>`-vv` for DEBUG |
|`-h, --help` | No | Displays help messaging information. |
 
### Arguments
 
 | Name | Required | Description |
 |:--- |:--- |:--- |
 |`PATH/formats` | Yes | `PATH` - The location of a model that is going to be exported. Models can be stored `only` in shared folders. Furthermore, this command _does not_ handle models located in local folders. The formats command (if given) displays a list of available formats.|
 |`FORMAT` | No | Format of an exported model. List of available formats can be obtained by executing `export formats` command. Required if `PATH` has been given.|
 |`operation options` | No | String with a list of parameters that are passed to a workflow responsible for exporting a model. All such parameters should be added at the end of the command after `--` string. |
 

### Returns
 
Should issues occur, a message (or messages) with a description of their cause (or causes) displays. If an export's operation starts, then the related operation information and its details displays.
If `formats` option is given, a list of available export formats with a short description of parameters accepted by those formats displays.
     
### Example 1

 Wait for Tensorboard to run.
 
 `nctl model export /mnt/input/home/pretrained_model openvino -- --output ArgMax` 
 
### Output 1

```
| Operation     | Start date           | End date   | Owner     | State   |
|---------------+----------------------+------------+-----------+---------|
| openvino_1    | 2019-07-17T16:13:40Z |            | jdoe      | Queued  |

```

### Example 2

Exports an existing model located in the `pretrained_model` folder in `input` shared folder.

 `nctl model export formats`
 
 ### Output 2
 
 Displays a list of available export formats with a short description of parameters accepted by them.  
 
 ```

|`-m, --match TEXT` | No |  If given, this command searches for logs from operations matching the value of this option. This option cannot be used along with the OPERATION-NAME argument.|
|`-o, --output` | No |  If given, the logs are stored in a file with a name derived from a name of an experiment.|
|`-pa, --pager` | No | Display the logs in interactive pager. Press *q* to exit the pager.|
