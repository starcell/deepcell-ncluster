# experiment Command

Use the `experiment` command to submit and manage experiments. This main command also includes the following subcommands:

 - [submit Subcommand](#submit-subcommand)
 - [list Subcommand](#list-subcommand)  
 - [cancel Subcommand](#cancel-subcommand)
 - [view Subcommand](#view-subcommand)
 - [logs Subcommand](#logs-subcommand)
 - [interact Subcommand](#interact-subcommand)
 
 
## submit Subcommand

### Synopsis
 
Use the `submit` subcommand to submit training jobs. Use this command to submit single and multi-node training jobs (by passing –t parameter with a name of a multi-node pack), and many jobs at once (by passing –pr/-ps parameters). If `-n/--name` parameter is not passed, experiment name will be automatically generated, by deriving a new, unique name from training script's name.
 
### Syntax
 
 `nctl experiment submit [options] SCRIPT-LOCATION [-- script-parameters]`
 
### Arguments

| Name | Required | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
|`SCRIPT-LOCATION` | Yes | Location and name of a Python script with a description of training. |
|`script-parameters` | No | String with a list of parameters that are passed to a training script. All such parameters should be added at the end of command after "--" string. |

## Options

| Name | Required | Description | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
|`-sfl, --script-folder-location`<br>`[folder_name] PATH` | No |Location and name of a folder with additional files used    by a script, for example: other .py files,data, and so on. If not given, then its content _will not_ be copied into the Docker image created by the `nctl submit` command. `nctl` copies all content, preserving its structure, including subfolder(s). |
|`-t, --template` <br>`[template_name] TEXT`| No | Name of a template that will be used by `nctl` to create a description of a job to be submitted. If not given, a default template for single node TensorFlow training is used (tf-training). List of available templates can be obtained by issuing the `nctl template list` command. |
|`-n, --name TEXT`| No | Name for this experiment.|
|`-p, --pack-param` <br> `<TEXT TEXT>…`| No |Additional pack parameter in format: `key value` or `key.subkey.subkey2 value`. For lists use: `'key "['val1', 'val2']"'`For maps use: `'key "{'a': 'b'}"'`|
|`-pr, --parameter-range` <br>`TEXT... [definition] <TEXT TEXT>...` | No | If the parameter is given, `nctl` starts as many experiments as there is a combination of parameters passed in `-pr` options Optional`[param_name]` is a name of a parameter that is passed to a training script. `[definition]` <br> <br> Contains values of this parameter that are passed to different instance of experiments. `[definition]` can have two forms: <br> <br> range: `{x...y:step}` This form says that `nctl`will launch a number of experiments equal to a number of values between `x` and `y` (including both values) with step `step`. <br> <br> set of values: `{x, y, z}`This form says that `nctl` will launch number of experiments equal to a number of values given in this definition.|
|`-ps, --parameter-set` <br>`[definition] TEXT` | No | If this parameter is given, `nctl` launches an experiment with a set of parameters that will be passed to experiment's script. Format of the `[definition]` argument is as follows: `{[param1_name]: [param1_value], [param2_name]: [param2_value], ..., [paramn_name]:[paramn_value]}`. <br>  <br> All parameters given in the `[definition]` argument will be passed to a training script under their names stated in this argument. If `ps` parameter is given more than once, `nctl` will start as many experiments as there is occurrences of this parameter in a call. |
|`-e, --env TEXT` | No | This is the environment variable passed to training. You can pass as many environmental variables, as desired. Each variable should be passed as a separate -e parameter.|
|`-r, --requirements PATH` | No | This is the path to the file with experiment's pip requirements. Dependencies listed in this file will be automatically installed using pip. |
|`-f, --force`| No | Force command execution by ignoring (most) confirmation prompts. |
|`-v, --verbose`| No | Set verbosity level: <br>`-v` for INFO <br>`-vv` for DEBUG |
|`-h, --help` | No | Displays help messaging information. |

#### Additional Remarks
 
 For both types of parameters: `-ps` and `-pr`; if, parameter stated in their definitions
 is also given in a `[script_parameters]`argument of the `nctl` command, then values taken from `-ps`
 and `-pr` are passed to a script.   
 
 If a combination of both parameters is given, then `nctl` launches a number of experiments
 equal to combination of values passed in those parameters. For example, if the following
 combination of parameters is passed to `nctl` command:
 
 `-pr param1 "{0.1, 0.2, 0.3}" -ps "{param2: 3, param4: 5}" -ps "{param6: 7}"` 
 
 Then the following experiments will be launched:
 
 ``` 
param1 = 0.1, param2 = 3, param4 = 5, param6 - not set
param1 = 0.2, param2 = 3, param4 = 5, param6 - not set
param1 = 0.3, param2 = 3, param4 = 5, param6 - not set`
param1 = 0.1, param2 = not set, param4 = not set, param6 - 7
param1 = 0.2, param2 = not set, param4 = not set, param6 - 7
param1 = 0.3, param2 = not set, param4 = not set, param6 - 7
 ```
 
### Returns
 
This command returns a list of submitted experiments with their names and statuses. In case of problems during submission, the command displays message/messages describing the causes. Errors may cause some experiments _to not be_ created and will be empty. If any error appears, then messages describing it are displayed with experiment's names/statuses. 
  
If one or more of experiment _has not been_ submitted successfully, then the command returns an exit code: `> 0`. The exact  value of the code depends on the cause of error(s) that prevented submitting the experiment(s).
     
### Example
 
`nctl experiment submit --name para-range --parameter-range lr "{0.1, 0.2, 0.3}" examples/mnist_single_node.py -- --data_dir=/mnt/input/root/public/MNIST`  
 
Starts multiple single node training jobs using `mnist_single_node.py` script located in the examples folder. 
Each training job uses a different learning rate value.

## list Subcommand
