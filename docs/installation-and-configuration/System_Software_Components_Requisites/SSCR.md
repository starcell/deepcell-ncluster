## Key Components

The Nauta installation package consists of two major components:

1. A package that installs a vanilla Kubernetes cluster, including necessary OS-level software components, on provisioned Hardware.

1. A package that installs Nauta components (including containers, configuration files, and so on) on the above-mentioned Kubernetes cluster.

Nauta software components are optimized for AI containers containing Nauta-optimized libraries.
